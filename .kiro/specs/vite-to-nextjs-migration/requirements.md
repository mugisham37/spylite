# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves migrating the existing SPYLT protein drink website from Vite.js to Next.js while maintaining 100% visual fidelity, preserving all GSAP animations, and leveraging Next.js optimization capabilities at the highest level. The migration must result in a production-ready application that looks and behaves identically to the original while gaining performance, SEO, and deployment benefits.

### Requirement 2: Animation System Preservation

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want all animations to work exactly as they did in the original site, so that the interactive experience is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling through sections THEN all ScrollTrigger animations SHALL fire at identical scroll positions
2. WHEN text animations play THEN SplitText character reveals SHALL match original timing and easing
3. WHEN ScrollSmoother is active THEN smooth scrolling behavior SHALL be identical to original
4. WHEN timeline animations execute THEN duration, delay, and easing curves SHALL match exactly
5. WHEN animations complete THEN cleanup and memory management SHALL prevent performance issues
6. WHEN testing on different devices THEN animation performance SHALL maintain 60fps consistently

### Requirement 3: Next.js Optimization Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage Next.js optimization features without compromising visual fidelity, so that the site gains performance benefits while maintaining appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images load THEN Next.js Image component SHALL optimize delivery without changing visual appearance
2. WHEN fonts render THEN Next.js font optimization SHALL improve loading without altering typography
3. WHEN code splits THEN dynamic imports SHALL optimize bundle size without affecting functionality
4. WHEN building for production THEN static generation SHALL improve performance metrics
5. WHEN SEO crawlers visit THEN meta tags and structured data SHALL be properly configured
6. WHEN caching occurs THEN static assets SHALL have optimal cache headers

### Requirement 4: GSAP SSR Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GSAP animations to work properly with Next.js server-side rendering, so that the site functions correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server-side rendering occurs THEN GSAP code SHALL only execute on client-side
2. WHEN hydration happens THEN animations SHALL initialize without visual flicker
3. WHEN plugins load THEN SplitText and other premium plugins SHALL be properly licensed and loaded
4. WHEN cleanup occurs THEN ScrollTrigger instances SHALL be properly destroyed on unmount
5. WHEN navigation happens THEN GSAP instances SHALL not cause memory leaks
6. WHEN refreshing occurs THEN animations SHALL reinitialize correctly

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the migrated site to load faster and perform better than the original, so that my browsing experience is enhanced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring Core Web Vitals THEN LCP SHALL be under 2.5 seconds
2. WHEN testing First Contentful Paint THEN FCP SHALL be under 1.8 seconds
3. WHEN checking Cumulative Layout Shift THEN CLS SHALL be under 0.1
4. WHEN analyzing bundle size THEN JavaScript payload SHALL not increase significantly
5. WHEN loading images THEN WebP/AVIF formats SHALL be served when supported
6. WHEN caching assets THEN proper cache strategies SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 6: TypeScript Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be fully typed with TypeScript, so that development is more robust and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting components THEN all React components SHALL be properly typed
2. WHEN defining props THEN interfaces SHALL be created for all component props
3. WHEN using GSAP THEN timeline and animation types SHALL be properly defined
4. WHEN handling events THEN event handlers SHALL have correct type annotations
5. WHEN importing modules THEN import/export statements SHALL use proper TypeScript syntax
6. WHEN building THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL complete without errors

### Requirement 7: Production Deployment Readiness

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the migrated site to be production-ready with proper monitoring and optimization, so that it can be deployed confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN build process SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN deploying THEN environment variables SHALL be properly configured
3. WHEN monitoring THEN error tracking SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN Lighthouse scores SHALL be above 90
5. WHEN testing cross-browser THEN functionality SHALL work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
6. WHEN validating accessibility THEN WCAG guidelines SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 8: Asset Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all static assets to be properly optimized and served, so that loading performance is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving images THEN Next.js Image optimization SHALL be utilized
2. WHEN loading videos THEN proper preloading and lazy loading SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN using fonts THEN Next.js font optimization SHALL be configured
4. WHEN caching assets THEN proper cache headers SHALL be set
5. WHEN compressing files THEN optimal compression SHALL be applied
6. WHEN serving from CDN THEN assets SHALL be properly distributed

### Requirement 9: Code Quality and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow Next.js and React best practices, so that it's maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
