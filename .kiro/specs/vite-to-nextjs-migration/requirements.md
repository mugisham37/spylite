# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves migrating a sophisticated Vite React GSAP website to Next.js while preserving all visual elements, animations, and user experience. The current project is an Awwwards-style website featuring complex GSAP animations, scroll effects, video content, and responsive design. The migration must maintain pixel-perfect visual fidelity while leveraging Next.js advanced features for improved performance, SEO, and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the migrated Next.js website to look and behave identically to the original Vite version, so that I experience the same visual quality and smooth animations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN the system SHALL display identical visual layout, typography, colors, and spacing as the original
2. WHEN scroll animations trigger THEN the system SHALL execute GSAP animations with identical timing, easing, and visual effects
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive behavior identical to the original
4. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide identical hover states, transitions, and feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to use Next.js App Router architecture, so that I can leverage modern Next.js features and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL use Next.js 14+ App Router with app directory structure
2. WHEN components are organized THEN the system SHALL follow Next.js conventions for layouts, pages, and components
3. WHEN routing is implemented THEN the system SHALL use Next.js file-based routing system
4. WHEN metadata is configured THEN the system SHALL use Next.js metadata API for SEO optimization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the website to load faster and perform better than the original, so that I have an improved browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL use Next.js Image component with optimization and lazy loading
2. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN the system SHALL use Next.js font optimization to prevent layout shift
3. WHEN videos are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement efficient video loading strategies
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL achieve better Core Web Vitals scores than the original

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GSAP animations to work seamlessly with Next.js SSR/SSG, so that animations function correctly without hydration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GSAP animations initialize THEN the system SHALL handle client-side only execution properly
2. WHEN the page hydrates THEN the system SHALL prevent animation conflicts during hydration
3. WHEN ScrollTrigger is used THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cleanup and re-initialization
4. WHEN using useGSAP hook THEN the system SHALL maintain animation performance and reliability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the exact same styling system, so that all visual elements remain identical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwind CSS is configured THEN the system SHALL preserve all custom theme configurations and utility classes
2. WHEN custom CSS is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain all component-specific styles and animations
3. WHEN responsive breakpoints are used THEN the system SHALL preserve identical responsive behavior
4. WHEN CSS-in-JS is needed THEN the system SHALL implement proper Next.js compatible solutions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want all media assets to be properly optimized and served, so that the website maintains visual quality while loading efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static images are served THEN the system SHALL use Next.js static asset optimization
2. WHEN videos are embedded THEN the system SHALL implement efficient video delivery strategies
3. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN the system SHALL use Next.js font optimization features
4. WHEN assets are referenced THEN the system SHALL maintain proper asset paths and accessibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to follow Next.js best practices for code organization, so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are structured THEN the system SHALL organize components following Next.js conventions
2. WHEN utilities and constants are organized THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Next.js directory structure
3. WHEN TypeScript is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide proper type safety throughout the application
4. WHEN configuration files are set up THEN the system SHALL use Next.js recommended configurations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and loading states, so that the application is robust and provides good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components load THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate loading states for heavy animations
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error boundaries and fallbacks
3. WHEN media fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback content
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL provide basic functionality and content access
