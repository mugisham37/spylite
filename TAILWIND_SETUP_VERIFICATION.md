# Tailwind CSS Setup Verification

## ✅ Task 2 Completed: Set up Tailwind CSS with custom theme preservation

### What was accomplished:

#### 1. ✅ Configure Tailwind CSS v4 with exact theme colors and fonts from original project

- Updated package.json with Tailwind CSS v4.1.8 and @tailwindcss/vite v4.1.8
- Configured @theme in globals.css with all original color variables:
  - `--color-black: #222123`
  - `--color-main-bg: #232224`
  - `--color-white: #ffffff`
  - `--color-dark-brown: #523122`
  - `--color-mid-brown: #a26833`
  - `--color-light-brown: #e3a458`
  - `--color-red-brown: #7f3b2d`
  - `--color-yellow-brown: #a26833`
  - `--color-milk-yellow: #e3d3bc`
  - `--color-red: #a02128`
  - `--color-milk: #faeade`
- Configured font families:
  - `--font-sans: "Antonio", sans-serif`
  - `--font-paragraph: "ProximaNova, sans-serif"`

#### 2. ✅ Create globals.css with all custom CSS classes and animations from index.css

- Migrated all @layer utilities classes:
  - `.flex-center`
  - `.col-center`
  - `.abs-center`
  - `.general-title`
- Migrated all @layer components classes:
  - `.paragraph-line`
  - `.hero-container` and all nested classes
  - `.message-content` and all nested classes
  - `.flavor-section` and all nested classes
  - `.nutrition-section` and all nested classes
  - `.benefit-section` and all nested classes
  - `.testimonials-section` and all nested classes
  - `.footer-section` and all nested classes
- Preserved custom CSS animations:
  - `.nutrition-section` radial gradient background
  - `.spin-circle` animation with keyframes

#### 3. ✅ Implement custom utility classes (flex-center, col-center, abs-center, general-title)

- All utility classes are properly defined in @layer utilities
- Classes use Tailwind's @apply directive for consistency
- Responsive behavior preserved with exact breakpoint values

#### 4. ✅ Test responsive breakpoints match original behavior exactly

- Verified responsive breakpoints work correctly (md: 768px, 2xl: 1536px)
- Created comprehensive test page demonstrating all features
- Build process completes successfully without errors

### Font Setup:

- ✅ Copied ProximaNova-Regular.otf to public/fonts/
- ✅ Updated layout.tsx to use Antonio font from Google Fonts
- ✅ Configured @font-face for ProximaNova in globals.css
- ✅ Set up proper font variables in @theme

### Dependencies Updated:

- ✅ tailwindcss: ^4.1.8
- ✅ @tailwindcss/vite: ^4.1.8
- ✅ PostCSS configuration already properly set up

### Verification:

- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ All custom colors are available as Tailwind classes
- ✅ All custom utility classes work as expected
- ✅ Component classes preserve exact styling from original
- ✅ Responsive behavior matches original project
- ✅ Font loading and display works correctly

### Requirements Satisfied:

- ✅ Requirement 5.1: Tailwind CSS preserves all custom theme configurations and utility classes

The Tailwind CSS setup is now complete and ready for the next migration tasks.
